# Top 10 Must-Have Wedding Photography Shots for Your NJ Wedding

Well, hello there, beautiful bride-to-be (and dashing groom, too)! So, you’re diving headfirst into the wild and wonderful world of wedding planning, eh? How thrilling! And nerve-wracking! And exhilarating! And did I mention utterly fabulous? Now, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from officiating more weddings than I can count (and trust me, I’ve seen it all—from barefoot beach vows to black-tie ballroom bashes), it’s that your wedding photos are the golden ticket to reliving every magical moment.

Now, you may be thinking, "But what if my photographer misses the shot of Aunt Mildred’s tear-streaked face during the vows? Or worse, what if they forget to snap that perfectly planned confetti toss?" Darling, fret not! I’m here to spill the beans on the top 10 must-have wedding photography shots that will keep your wedding day alive forever, even after the cake is gone and your feet have recovered from all that dancing.

## 1. The Power of the Shot List: Don’t Leave Home Without It

First things first—let’s talk shot lists. Oh, you’ve never heard of a shot list? Let me tell you, honey, it’s the secret sauce that ensures every precious moment is captured. Imagine your photographer as an artist (which they are, by the way), and the shot list is the canvas. This little gem is where you’ll jot down every single shot you simply must have—from that epic first kiss to the stolen glances during the ceremony. But don’t worry, I’ve got a cheat sheet for you.

**Must-Have Shots:**

- The First Look (because seeing each other for the first time? Priceless.)
- The Ceremony Setup (before guests arrive—it’s your Pinterest dream come to life!)
- The Ring Exchange (that tiny circle of gold, sealing your love.)
- The First Kiss (cue the fireworks, darling!)
- The Confetti Toss (because who doesn’t love a shower of joy?)

## 2. Creative Venue Ideas: Say Goodbye to Cookie-Cutter Photos

Let’s talk venues, shall we? Whether you’re getting hitched in a charming NJ barn or a swanky downtown loft, your venue is the backdrop to your love story. And let’s face it, New Jersey has some killer spots that will make your photos stand out. Now, here’s a tip from the trenches: consider your venue when choosing where to snap those pics. Does your venue have a hidden garden? Or maybe a rooftop with a view that will make your guests gasp? Scout it out, darling, and let your photographer work their magic.

**Storytime!**
One couple I worked with had their ceremony in a quaint little chapel surrounded by trees. We found the most enchanting little nook where the sun streamed through the leaves—utterly romantic. And let me tell you, those photos turned out like something straight out of a fairytale.

## 3. Timing is Everything: The Golden Hour, Your Best Friend

If I had a dollar for every time I’ve told a couple about the magic of Golden Hour… well, I’d probably have enough to buy another pair of fabulous shoes. Trust me when I say that timing is everything when it comes to wedding photos. Golden Hour—the dreamy period just after sunrise or before sunset—will bathe you and your love in the most flattering, ethereal light. Talk to your photographer about planning some shots during this time; it’s like nature’s gift to your wedding album.

And what if it rains? No worries, darling! Some of the most swoon-worthy photos I’ve ever seen were taken in the rain. Think umbrellas, puddles, and reflections—utterly romantic!

## 4. Capturing Candid Moments: The Unscripted Magic

Now, let’s chat about the candid shots. Oh, the glorious, unplanned moments that are so full of life and love! It’s not just about the posed pictures, sweetheart—those in-between moments are where the magic happens. The tear in your partner’s eye during the vows, the flower girl giggling as she runs down the aisle, or that sneaky little kiss you share when you think no one’s watching. These are the moments that make your heart skip a beat every time you look at your photos.

**Pro Tip:** Let your photographer know how much these moments mean to you. The more they know about your vision, the better they can capture it!

## 5. The Role of a Second Shooter: Twice the Fun, Twice the Memories

Ah, the second shooter—a gift from the wedding gods! If your budget allows, having a second photographer can make all the difference. While your main photographer is busy capturing the grand moments, the second shooter can grab those side-angle shots, the guests’ reactions, and the little details that might otherwise go unnoticed. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.

**Quick Story:**
At one wedding, the couple had their dog (yes, their DOG!) deliver the rings in a tiny tuxedo. It was the cutest thing you’ve ever seen, but while everyone was focused on the dog, the second shooter captured the pure joy on the guests’ faces. It was a moment that would have been missed without that extra lens!

## 6. The Family Group Photos: Organized Chaos, But Worth It

Let’s not forget about the family group photos. I know, I know—coordinating everyone for these shots can feel like herding cats, but it’s so worth it. To make it easier, consider creating a list of who should be in each shot and designate someone (a loud cousin works great) to help round everyone up. And remember, your photographer is a pro at this, so let them take the lead.

## 7. Creative and Unique Shots: Make It Personal

Here’s where we get really fun—let’s talk about personal touches. Whether it’s a backlit veil shot that makes you look like you just stepped out of a dream, or a candid moment of you two sneaking away during the reception for some alone time, these are the photos that will take your breath away. Don’t be afraid to think outside the box and suggest creative ideas to your photographer. After all, this is your love story, and it should be told your way.

**A Few Ideas:**

- A “sneak away” session during the reception for those intimate, breathtaking shots.
- A playful moment with a sign or prop that’s meaningful to you both.
- Backlit photos through flowing veils or lace that create a magical, ethereal vibe.

## 8. Scouting the Location: Plan Ahead for Perfection

If you’re anything like me, you love to plan. So why not take a little time to scout out your venue before the big day? Walk through with your photographer, find the best spots, and plan where you’ll take each shot. This way, when the day comes, you’ll know exactly where to go, and you won’t waste any precious time.

## 9. Don’t Forget the Details: It’s All in the Little Things

The details, darling, the details! Your wedding day is filled with them—from the intricate lace on your dress to the delicate petals of your bouquet. Make sure your photographer captures these little moments of beauty. They might seem small now, but trust me, when you’re flipping through your wedding album years down the road, these are the things that will bring a tear to your eye.

## 10. The Grand Exit: Ending on a High Note

Last, but certainly not least, is the grand exit. Whether you’re leaving under a canopy of sparklers, a shower of flower petals, or simply in a getaway car with a “Just Married” sign, this moment is one of pure joy and excitement. Make sure your photographer is ready to capture the magic as you and your new spouse embark on your happily ever after.

And there you have it! Follow these tips, and you’ll end up with a wedding album that’s not just a collection of photos, but a treasure trove of memories that you’ll cherish forever. Remember, your wedding day is a once-in-a-lifetime event—make sure every glorious, love-filled moment is captured just the way you want it. Now go out there and get married in style, my dear!

With love and a camera-ready smile,  
Celia
